# This is a sample YAML file for fault injection configuration
# The fields here should correspond to the Fields in fiConfig.py

# Deterministic fault seed for the injections
# Seed: 1000

# Type of fault to be injected for Scalars and Tensors
# Allowed values are: {None, Rand, Zero, Rand-element, bitFlip-element, bitFlip-tensor}
#   1) None - do not inject fault
#   2) Rand - shuffle all the data items in the output of the target op into random values
#   3) Zero - change the value into all zeros
#   4) Rand-element - shuffle one of the data item in the output of the target op into random value
#   5) bitFlip-element - single bit-flip over one data item in the output of the target op
#   6) bitFlip-tensor - single bit-flip over all data items in the output of the target op 
ScalarFaultType: bitFlip-element
TensorFaultType: bitFlip-element 


# Add the list of Operations and their probabilities here
# Each entry must be in a separate line ad start with a '-'
# each line must represent an OP and it's probability value
# See fiConfig.py for a full list of allowed OP values
# NOTE: These should not be any tabs anywhere below

Ops:
# Choose operations which you want to inject
  - ALL = 1.0 # Chooses ADD
#  - LRN = 1.0 # Choose one operation only; 
# - EQUAL = 1.0
#  - SOFT-MAX = 1.0
# - DIV = 0.0 # This does not exist - and should be ignored (Test)
# - SUB = -0.5 # This should raise an exception

# How many times the set of above operations should be skipped before injection
# SkipCount: 1


# Specify the instances of the ML operators 
# This is required when you want to specify which operator to inject (e.g., the second Conv operator).
# Below is an example, you need to specify the numbers according to your model.
Instances: 
#  - ADD = 1



# There are three inject mode:
# There are 3 ways to determine HOW to select an operation for injection"
# 1) Using error rate to determine the probability of each opertaor to be injected " 
# 2) Profiling the instance of each operation so that each operation will be injected for ONCE only" 
# 3) Perform random injection over one op per run". In this mode, the 'ALL' variable in the Ops section must be used explicitly. 
# In the second and third mode, you'll need to specify the instances of all the operators in the algorithm

# Allowed values: 1) "errorRate"; 2) "dynamicInstance"; 3) "oneFaultPerRun" 
InjectMode: "errorRate"
